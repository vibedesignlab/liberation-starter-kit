# Chaining contract

The pipeline uses one shared `pipeline-state.json`. Each stage keeps its own existing `stage-review.json`; no second approval format is introduced.

For a full single-brand chain, the router also uses the shared [parallel execution contract](parallel-execution-contract.md). Parallel jobs never cross a review gate and never replace explicit user approval.

## Transition rule

1. Finishing files or passing validation never advances a stage by itself.
2. Present the current stage and its short adjustment checkpoint to the user.
3. Interpret a clear response such as `승인`, `조절 없음`, or `그대로 진행` as `accepted`. Interpret requested changes as `revision_requested`.
4. Record that decision with `advance_pipeline.py`. The script checks the current registration receipt and drift before accepting; it does not rerun the Stage validator.
5. On `CHAIN_ACTION=CALL_SKILL`, immediately read and execute the named next skill in the same conversation. Reuse the printed package paths; do not repeat intake already stored in the pipeline.
6. On `CHAIN_ACTION=STAY`, revise the current stage and present the checkpoint again.
7. Stage 3 acceptance produces `CHAIN_ACTION=COMPLETE`. It does not start page design or coding.

Inside the active stage, the coordinator may complete several bounded jobs concurrently. Only the coordinator writes canonical package files and calls `advance_pipeline.py`. A worker finishing a shard or image never advances the stage.

## Commands

Create a pipeline and its three package directories:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_pipeline.py <pipeline-directory> \
  [--stage-1-package <source-package>] \
  [--stage-2-package <extended-package>] \
  [--stage-3-package <landing-package>]
```

Record explicit user feedback and advance or stay:

```bash
python3 scripts/advance_pipeline.py <pipeline-directory> \
  --decision accepted \
  --feedback "사용자 승인 원문 또는 짧은 요약"
```

```bash
python3 scripts/advance_pipeline.py <pipeline-directory> \
  --decision revision_requested \
  --feedback "수정 요청 원문 또는 짧은 요약"
```

Without `--decision`, the script reports or follows the decision already stored in the current stage review file.

Track material parallel jobs without adding a second content artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/update_job.py <pipeline-directory> \
  --stage stage_2 --job product_anchor --parallel-group stage2_anchors \
  --status running --owner image-worker
```

## Standalone use

If a user asks for only one stage, do not create pipeline state. That stage ends normally at its review checkpoint. Chaining is active only when the router was invoked or a `pipeline_state_path` is registered.
